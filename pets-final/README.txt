This website has four pages and is meant to showcase and promote a pet store and its products and services.
Javascript is used on three out of these four pages to showcase some elements and make the site more interesting.
On the "Home" page, there is a gallery-like animation that shows four images of different animals alternating
positions.
"Blog" page shows different posts on the right side every time it is refreshed, and the main posts get a border
everytime they are hovered over.
The last page with javascript used on it is "Services" page, on which the green circles with icons on them change
color everytime the mouse is hovered over the 'View More' button under each circle.
